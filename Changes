Revision history for Perl extension File::Path.

2.03 2007-11-04 18:11:51 UTC
    - On 5.8.x, the installation would be shadowed by the core
      files, and thus not be visible. Makefile.PL tweaked
      appropriately to ensure that the installation overwrites
      the core files. Users on 5.6 and below need not upgrade,
      users on 5.8 should. Bug spotted by imacat (#30459).
    - Minor changes to the way POD tests are initialised.

2.02 2007-10-24 10:05:30 UTC
    - documentation correction fix only: corrected name of module
      File::Find::Rule. Users need not upgrade.

2.01 2007-09-29 10:16:34 UTC
    - the documentation referred to 'skip_others', but the attribute
      is named 'safe'.
    - correctly test VMS behaviour when safe attribute is set.

2.00_11 2007-09-08 12:51:30 UTC
    - depth attribute (for keep_root functiionality) was not
      correctly initialised in both old and new APIs
    - initial chdir() into a child dir would fail on strange
      protection masks (following race condition fix).
    - delete subsequent root paths even if a previous one fails

2.00_10 2007-09-04 17:18:01 UTC
    - Infinite loop fix in _rmtree() for VMS (perl change #31775)
    - Documentation improvements

2.00_09 2007-08-20 18:08:31 UTC

    - Reworded/reworked the diagnostics

    - Use catfile() instead of catdir() in _mkpath() for VMS,
      patch from Craig Berry.
    - Don't use warnings (my code doesn't have errors anyway),
      code change suggested by Rafael Garcia-Suarez.
    - Don't pass LICENSE key to WriteMakefile in Makefile.PL
      if the installed version of ExtUtils::MakeMaker is not
      sufficiently modern.

    - Don't allow a directory named '' (empty string) to be created.
    - File::Spec routines catdir() and updir() interact differently on Win32
    - $! needs to be managed more carefully on Win32
