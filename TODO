Things TODO for File::Path

1. Write a batch file to be run as Administrator on Win32
   that sets up files that cannot be removed with the
   current user (and will hit code paths that are never
   visited under Unix). Useful for code coverage improvements.

2. See if http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=75696 is
   still relevant.

3. Can rmtree initial paths be sanitised before diving into
   _rmtree(), in a way that would reduce platform-specific
   workarounds therein?

4. Investigate rm -p functionality (a linux thing).

5. Consider adding File::Remove trash() functionality.
